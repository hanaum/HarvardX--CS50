0.  number of colors supported:
    BMP = 32 bits
    GIF = 8 bits
    JPEG = 24 bits
    PNG = 24 bits

1.  GIF

2.  lossy compression causes some data in the file to be lost during compression.
    lossless compression allows the compression of a file to not lose data.

3.  JPEG

4.  The information in the address is erased but the file itself remains on the hardrive.

5.  Need to implement a secure 'delete' option that actually replaces every addressable block with 0's.

6.  stdint.h is a header file that declares sets of integer types having a specified widths.

7.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t are all exact-width integer types that states an integer as an
    exact number of bytes.

8.  Number of bytes:
    BYTE = 1 
    DWORD = 4
    LONG = 4
    WORD = 2
    
9.  The first two bytes for a BMP file must be ASCII values 'B' and 'M'

10. bfSize will describe the file's size in bytes.
    biSize will describe the size of the structure in bytes

11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner

12. biBitCount specififes the number of bits per pizel. This value is the implied bit depth of the uncompressed image

13. fopen could return NULL if there is no memory avaiable for the file 

14. The fread is always set to one because it reads through the file 1 btye at a time

15. padding = 12 bytes

16. fseek sets up the file position indicator.

17. 
18. cs50 TA holding a cat-like object. I'm guessing the cat dunit
